# Age-Estimation
2020/2021 sem 2 - FYP Individual Project Phase 1 - Age Estimation based on Skull Size - Read the image by using OpenCV and train the model by using Scikit-Learn.

By using manually created CT image, detect the plotted points and calculate the measurement by using OpenCV and 
some mathematical formula to make measurement with the pixels from the CT image.

After performing GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV on the models,the best performance model is Random Forest Regressor with the new RMSE of 1.1
